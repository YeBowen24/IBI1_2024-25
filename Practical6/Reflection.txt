Due to my insufficient understanding of the topic, the compilation process of the Task1 code encountered some problems, which took a long time.
My own Task2 code had problems, so I used AI tools to correct my code. However, the correction effect of AI tools on my code did not meet my expectations.
For Task3, with my current understanding and learning of the code, I cannot write a good enough code that meets the requirements, so I used AI tools to generate my code.
