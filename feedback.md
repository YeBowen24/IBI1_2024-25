# SCORE: 57.73

# Week3:
The "Reflection.txt" file not exist in the Practical 3 folder.
--Created the file.
Commit messages for Week 3 are not informative.
--In the subsequent code submission, write Commit messages strictly in accordance with the norms.

# Week4:
The values of c and f were not compared correctly in variables.py, and the values of c and e were not compared either.
--Add corresponding judgment statements, and output the correct comparison results.
In the logic involving the variable W, the value of W was not created correctly, and no truth table comment was provided.
--Carefully understand the logical relationship, ensure that the value of W is true only when both X and Y are true, and operate with appropriate logical operators.
In the triangle.py code, only a sum is printed and the first 10 values of the triangle sequence are not displayed correctly.
--Modify the code logic, use a loop structure to calculate the first 10 values of the triangle sequence in sequence, and print them out correctly to ensure that the output result is consistent with the sequence required by the problem.
Pseudo-code is not used in multiple files and the code is not adequately annotated.
--In the subsequent code writing, first write detailed pseudo-code, plan the code flow and logical structure well, and then convert it into actual programming code.

# Week5:
The displayed bar chart lacks the X-axis label, Y-axis label and title.
--Add complete X-axis labels, Y-axis labels, and chart titles
Two sorted population lists were not printed, and the displayed pie chart did not meet the requirements
--Modify the code to ensure that the population ranking list of the United Kingdom and the neighboring provinces of Zhejiang can be printed correctly.
