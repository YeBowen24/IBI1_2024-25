pseudocode

Create a dictionary with programming languages as keys and their corresponding percentages as values, then print the dictionary
 
Convert the dictionary to a pandas DataFrame with column names 'Language' and 'Percentage'
 
Sort the DataFrame by the 'Percentage' column in descending order
 
Plot a bar chart, set the figure size, with x-axis as 'Language' and y-axis as 'Percentage'
 
Add x-axis label as 'Language Type', y-axis label as 'Number of Users', include a legend, and finally display the chart
 
Start an infinite loop:
Prompt the user to input the programming language they want to search
If the input language exists in the dictionary:
Get the corresponding percentage and store it in variable 'out'
Break the loop
Else:
Notify the user that the language doesn't exist in the dictionary and request correct input
Print the variable 'out' (the percentage found for the user's query)
