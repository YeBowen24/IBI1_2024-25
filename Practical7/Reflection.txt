The task of this Practical is relatively simple, but because an exhaustive method was used, the code's efficiency may not be high enough.

I haven't yet learned how to save the results generated by the code to the current folder, which requires more learning in the future.
So in the local version of the code, I used the absolute path of the file to read the file and get the result. In the GitHub version of the code, I changed the path and this change may cause errors in the code.
